# Introduction

SolidityScan is a cloud-based Smart-contract vulnerability scanner built to discover vulnerabilities and help publish audit reports after the vulnerability mitigations.

SolidityScan scans all your smart contacts code to detect known potential security vulnerabilities in code and anti-patterns. The product aims to sit in your development pipeline, run the scan on your contactâ€™s code, and flag known vulnerabilities. The end output from the product is an audit report of your code, which has information on which parts of your code might lead to potential security vulnerabilities.

The application also outputs the security score helping developers understand the security posture of their contracts and rescan their contracts after bug fixing to improve their score and publish the audit report to the community.
