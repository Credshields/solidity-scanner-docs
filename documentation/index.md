# Introduction

SolidityScan is a cloud-based smart-contract vulnerability scanner built to discover vulnerabilities and help publish audit reports after vulnerability mitigations.

SolidityScan scans all of your smart contract code to detect potential security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns. The product aims to sit in your development pipeline, run the scan on your contract's code, and flag known vulnerabilities. The end output from the product is an audit report of your code, which contains information on which parts of your code might lead to potential security vulnerabilities.

The application also outputs a security score, which helps developers understand the security posture of their contracts. They can then rescan their contracts after bug fixing to improve their score and publish the audit report to the community.

# What are we trying to do?

SolidityScan aims to provide security audits with just a click of a button, helping developers, organizations, and security teams to discover security vulnerabilities and publish reports once they have been fixed.

# Solidity Scan Features:

- [Scan a Project](./project)
  Scan your public and private repositories hosted on Github.
- [Scan a Contract deployed on Chain](./block)
  Initiate scans on contracts deployed both on Testnets and Mainnets. SolidityScan currently supports Ethereum, Binance, Polygon, Avalanche and Fantom.
- [Upload and Scan a .sol File](./project)
  Upload your Solidity Files (.sol, .Sol) and scan them.
- [Generate and Publish Reports](./report)
  Generate your scan reports to get a detailed view on the vulnerabilities found in your source code. With your issues fixed, publish your report and share over the public link with your stakeholders.
- [Integrations](./integrations)
  Integrate SolidityScan with your github repository to conduct scans on your private repos.
