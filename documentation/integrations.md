# Integrating the App with Different Services

You have an option to integrate our app with multiple platforms.
Currently, we provide you with the service to integrate with the following platforms:

1. Github
2. Bitbucket
3. Gitlab
4. Slack

In the future, we will also be providing the option to integrate it with JIRA.

To give you an understanding of the integration process of these platforms, we have provided you with an example of how to integrate our app with your Github Account.

## Step 1: Request to Connect With Github

First, make sure you are on the Pro or Custom Plan. This service is only available for these Plans.

Once your plan is upgraded, click on the Connect Button to send a request to connect to Github.
