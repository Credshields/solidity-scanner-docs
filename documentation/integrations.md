# Integrating the App with Diffrent Services

You have an option to integrate our app with your GitHub account. In the future, we will also be providing the option to integrate it with Slack and JIRA.

# Step 1: Request to Connect With Github

First, Make sure you are on the Pro or Custom Plan. This Service is only available for these Plans.

Once your plan is upgraded, click on the Connect Button to send a request to connect to Github.
