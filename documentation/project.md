# Scanning a Project using Solidity Scan

Let's go through the process of scanning a project/repository using Solidity Scan. We've tried to make this process as simple and automated as possible.

# Step 1: Create an account on Solidity Scan

First, let's create an account on Solidity Scan. If you have already created an account, you can skip this step. To create a new account, Let's head on to: [solidityscan.com](https://solidityscan.com/signup).

# Step 2: Enter the project you need to Scan

Once the account is created, enter the project's name and the repository link for the project. Also, select if the repository is public or private. Click on the button to start the scan.

After you have started the scan, you will see the below screen.

# Step 3: View the results of the scan

On successful completion of the scan, click on it to get more details about the scan.

You will have an option to do a re-scan of the project. You can also view the statics of the scan and the details of the issues found in the project.

# Step 3: View the detailed result of the scan

To get a more detailed scan result, you can navigate through the tabs. Click on the Detailed result tab to see the issues and vulnerabilities found in the scan in a detailed way.

Here you can see the list of the issues found in the scan. When you click on any of these issues, you will see the list of the files containing these issues. After selecting the files, you can see exactly where the vulnerability exactly lies in the file and what is the possible solution to remediate the vulnerability.

# Step 4: View the Scan history

You can see the history of the scans done for this project here. All the re-scans done can be seen here.

Click on any one of the scans to view the result for that scan.
