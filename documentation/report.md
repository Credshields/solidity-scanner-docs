# Generate a Report for the Scan Done

Once a scan is completed, you have the option to generate and publish a report of the scan. Follow these steps to do so:

## Step 1: Generate the Report

First, scan a project or a deployed contract. If you haven't scanned anything yet, head over here to [scan a project](/project/) or here to [scan a deployed contract](/block/) or to [scan a file](/filescan/).

Once you have finished scanning a project, deployed contract, or file, click on the "Generate Report" button.

After generating the report, you will have the option to view it.

## Step 2: Publish Your Report

Once you have reviewed the report and updated its results, you can publish it for sharing.

To publish a report, click on the "Publish Report" button.

You can publish two types of reports:

1. **Self-Published Reports**: In this report, you take responsibility for identifying and documenting false positive bugs.
2. **Verified Reports**: This report undergoes verification by our security team.

When you click on the "Publish Report" button, you will be given three options:
