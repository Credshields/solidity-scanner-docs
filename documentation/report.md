# Scanning a Contract using Solidity Scan

Let's go through the process of scanning a project/repository using Solidity Scan. We've tried to make this process as simple and automated as it could be.

# Step 1: Create an account on Solidity Scan

First, let's create an account on Solidity Scan. To, create a new account Let's head on to: [solidityscan.com](https://solidityscan.com/signup). If you have already created an account, you can skip this step.

# Step 2: Enter the project you need to Scan

Once the account is created, Enter the name of the projects and the repository link for the project. Also select if the repository is publicj or private. Click on the button to start the scan.
