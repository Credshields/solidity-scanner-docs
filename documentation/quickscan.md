#### Doing a Quickscan for a Verfied Smart Contract

##### Step 1: Enter the details of the contract

Head over to the [Quickscan Page](https://solidityscan.com/quickscan)

Enter the link to the contract from the ledger. Select the blockchain platform on which this transaction has taken place. Also, select the contract chain for this transaction.

###### Please follow the constraints below to avoid scan failure:

1. Navigate to the explorer of the particular blockchain (Ethereum - Etherscan.io).
2. Use the search bar to get your smart contract and check if the source code is verified in the "Contract" tab of the selected explorer.

##### Step 2: View the results of the scan

On successful completion of the scan, you will be taken to the result section.

You can see an overview of the scan done here.

It also gives you a Threat Scan Summary which identifies potential rug pull scams by providing an in-depth analysis of a smart contract's code
