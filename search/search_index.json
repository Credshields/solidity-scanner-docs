To, create a new account Let's head on to: solidityscan.com . If you have already created an account, you can skip this step. Step 2: Enter the project you need to Scan Once the account is created, Enter the name of the projects and the repository link for the project. Also select if the repository is public or private. Click on the button to start the scan. After you have started the scan, you will see the below screen. Step 3: View the results of the scan On success completion of the scan, click on it to get more details about the scan. You will have an option to do a re-scan of the project. You can also view the statics of the scan as well as the statistics of the issues found in the project.
