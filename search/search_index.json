SolidityScan scans all your smart contacts code to detect known potential security vulnerabilities in code and anti-patterns. The product aims to sit in your development pipeline, run the scan on your contact\u2019s code, and flag known vulnerabilities. The end output from the product is an audit report of your code, which has information on which parts of your code might lead to potential security vulnerabilities. The application also outputs the security score helping developers understand the security posture of their contracts and rescan their contracts after bug fixing to improve their score and publish the audit report to the community. What are we trying to do? SolidityScan aims to provide security audits at a click of a button, helping developers, organizations, and security teams discover security vulnerabilities and publish reports after fixing them.

We've tried to make this process as simple and automated as possible. Step 1: Create an account on Solidity Scan First, let's create an account on Solidity Scan. If you have already created an account, you can skip this step. To create a new account, Let's head on to: solidityscan.com . Step 2: Enter the project you need to Scan Once the account is created, enter the project's name and the repository link for the project. Also, select if the repository is public or private. Click on the button to start the scan. After you have started the scan, you will see the below screen. Step 3: View the results of the scan On successful completion of the scan, click on it to get more details about the scan. You will have an option to do a re-scan of the project. You can also view the statics of the scan and the details of the issues found in the project. Step 3: View the detailed result of the scan To get a more detailed scan result, you can navigate through the tabs. Click on the Detailed result tab to see the issues and vulnerabilities found in the scan in a detailed way. Here you can see the list of the issues found in the scan. When you click on any of these issues, you will see the list of the files containing these issues. After selecting the files, you can see exactly where the vulnerability exactly lies in the file and what is the possible solution to remediate the vulnerability.

Click on the \"View Report\" button to view your Generated Report. You can view the following section in your report. There is a section to view the complete summary of the vulnerabilities found. You can also see the History of the Scans conducted for that project. You can also see the list of all the vulnerabilities found during the latest scan in the report. Step 3: Update the Report After you have completed going through the report, you can update the status of the vulnerabilities found in the scan. The scanner automatically updates the status of bugs found to be fixed after performing the rescan. If you do not want to update the status of any vulnerabilities you can skip this step and procced to Step 4. To update the Report, Click on the Update Report button. Here we ask a bit of your help to update the status of the vulnerabilities found so that we can improve our scanner engine to give better results. All the Vulnerabilities are listed here, along with their status. Click on any one of the vulnerabilities, and you will find the list of files containing these vulnerabilities along with their status. If you feel that the vulnerability found is a False Positive, Please mark that, or if you feel you don't need to fix this vulnerability and it is better the way it is, please mark the status as Won't fix. Once you are done, Please Click on the Update Report button at the bottom, as shown below. Once you have updated the report, the status of these vulnerabilities will get updated, and the newly updated status will be shown in the report thereafter. Step 4: Publish Your Report Once you have gone through the report and updated its results, you also have an option to Publish a report for the scan that was carried out so that it can be shared with anyone.
