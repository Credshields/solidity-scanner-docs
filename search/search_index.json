SolidityScan scans all of your smart contract code to detect potential security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns. The product aims to sit in your development pipeline, run the scan on your contract's code, and flag known vulnerabilities. The end output from the product is an audit report of your code, which contains information on which parts of your code might lead to potential security vulnerabilities. The application also outputs a security score, which helps developers understand the security posture of their contracts. They can then rescan their contracts after bug fixing to improve their score and publish the audit report to the community. What are we trying to do? SolidityScan aims to provide security audits with just a click of a button, helping developers, organizations, and security teams to discover security vulnerabilities and publish reports once they have been fixed. Solidity Scan Features: Scan a Project Scan your public and private repositories hosted on Github. Scan a Contract deployed on Chain Initiate scans on contracts deployed both on Testnets and Mainnets. SolidityScan currently supports Ethereum, Binance, Polygon, Avalanche and Fantom. Upload and Scan a .sol File Upload your Solidity Files (.sol, .Sol) and scan them. Generate and Publish Reports Generate your scan reports to get a detailed view on the vulnerabilities found in your source code. With your issues fixed, publish your report and share over the public link with your stakeholders.

We've tried to make this process as simple and automated as possible. Create an account on Solidity Scan First, let's create an account on Solidity Scan. If you have already created an account, you can skip this o create a new account, Let's head on to: solidityscan.com . Enter the project you need to Scan Once the account is created, you can start scanning your solidity project by following these steps: STEP 1: Enter Project Information Enter the project's name and the repository link for the project. When entering the link please verify the following to avoid scan failure: Ensure the link is to a GitHub repository containing Solidity (.sol) files. It is recommended to use the HTTPS GitHub (.git) cloning link of the repository. Verify if the repository is public, for private repositories, please integrate your GitHub from the Integrations tab. Also, select if the repository is public or private. Click on the next button to proceed to Step 2. STEP 2: Select Branch and Files to be Scanned After you have entered the github repository link, you will be asked to select a branch that contains the project which has to be scanned. By default, the default branch on your github repository will be selected. Also you will have an option to select files and folders that you want to scan. The files and folders that are not selected will be skipped in the scanning process. Note: Only solidity files (files with .sol, .Sol extension) will be scanned Once you are done configuring your settings, click on next to proceed to Step 3. STEP 3: Configure Webhooks for Github Actions You have the option to trigger automatic scans using Github Actions. Whenever a new commit will be pushed to the branch, if webhook has been enabled then it will trigger a scan automatically to check if the new changes have any vulnerabilities present. You can only configure webhooks for those github respository which are owned by you (user). Also this funcationality is only possible once you have connected your github account with SolidityScan Application. Here are the steps to do the. Watch this tutorial on How to Integrate your Github account with SolidityScan. After you have configured your settings click on Start Scan Button to initiate the scan. After you have started the scan, you will see the below screen. Watch this tutorial on How to do a Project Scan. View the results of the scan On successful completion of the scan, click on it to get more details about the scan. You will have an option to do a re-scan of the project. You can also view the statistics of the scan and the details of the issues found in the project. Overview of the Project You get the an understanding about how secure your project is and get an overall idea about the issue and vulnerabilities in your project. Using the quantitative scoring present here, you can draw a quick comparison about the security of the projects and how it has evolved over the time. Detailed Result of the scan. To get a more detailed scan result, you can navigate through the tabs. Click on the Detailed result tab to see the issues and vulnerabilities found in the scan in a detailed way. There is an option to view vulnerability description in expanded view. You can also choose to close the description box if its obstructing the Code View. Filtering bugs using Confidence/Vulnerability Parameter and Bug Status There might be times where our tool might detetct a lot of vulnerabilities in your code. To find and focus on what is important for you, you can filter the issues/vulnerabilities/bugs based on the following paramenter: Severity of Vulnerability: (High, Critical, Medium, Low, Info, Gas) Confidence rating of Vulnerabilty Detector: (Certain, Firm, Tentative) Vulnerabilities Flag of bug status : (Won't Fix, False Positive, Pending Fixes) Updating Bug Status We have a functionality where we keep a track of the status of the bugs present. You can update the status of the vulnerabilities found in the scan basis to track the work. Here we ask a bit of your help to update the status of the vulnerabilities found so that we can improve our scanner engine to give better results. All the Vulnerabilities in your code are listed here, along with their status. Click on any one of the vulnerabilities, and you will find the list of files containing these vulnerabilities along with their status. You also have an option to multiple select issues or batch of issues together and mark their status atr once. If you feel you don't need to fix this vulnerability and it is better the way it is, please mark the status as Won't fix. To mark wont-fix status you also have to add a comment while doing it explaining why there isn't a need to fix the vulnerablity. If you feel that the vulnerability found is a False Positive, Please mark that. There is also an option to reset a bug status to default again if you feel if you might need to fix it. The scanner automatically updates the status of bugs found to be fixed after performing the rescan. Updating Comments on Bug You can also update comments on your comments done on a bug. Watch the Tutorial on How to Navigate through your vulnerability scan results on SolidityScan. Configure Settings of a Project You can Configure Settings on a Project for future scans.
